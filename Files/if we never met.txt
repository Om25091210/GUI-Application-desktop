[Chorus]
If we never met
I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else’s bed
I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't even know what love is
If we never met

[Verse 1]
What if I never started singing?
What if you never told your family you were leaving?
When you felt the pressure
There’s a million different reasons
We shouldn't be together
But when I put it all together

[Pre-Chorus]
It all comes back to you, you, you
I love it when the only light is me, you, and the moon
And baby, when I close my eyes, I'm thinkin' about...

[Chorus]
If we never met
I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else's bed
I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't even know what love is
If we never met

[Verse 2]
What if I never left Nashville?
What if you never called me back when I asked you?
Somethin’ stupid ’bout the weather
It all happened for a reason
'Cause you put me back together
But when I put it all together

[Pre-Chorus]
It all comes back to you, you, you
I love it when the only light is me, you, and the moon
And baby, when I close my eyes, I’m thinkin' about...

[Chorus]
If we never met
I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else's bed
I’d be lost in a crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't even know what love is
If we never met
