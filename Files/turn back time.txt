We used to run red lights and never look back
We used to chase long nights, nothing wrong with that
'Cause I loved you and I lost my mind
And now, I try to leave it, oh, I try
But you still haunt me no matter where I go
And you hated my lasagna but you came back for more
You got me running circles in your favorite store
And I lost you and I lost my mind
And now, I try to leave it all behind
But I still see you no matter where I go

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time and make it all alright
Only a piece of you and me will keep me warm all night
If I could turn back time and rewrite every line
If only I could, but baby, I can't

[Post-Chorus]
So I'ma scream, shout, let it all out
And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you
So I'ma scream, shout, let it all out
And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you

[Verse 2]
I hit you up like, "Hey girl, can we talk right now?
I know you're far away, girl, can we hang right now?"
'Cause I loved you and I lost my mind
And now, I try to leave it all behind
But I still see you no matter where I go
I know it's getting late, girl, I don't care right now
I tried to call you on the phone, girl, but you don't pick up
And I lost you and I lost my mind
Now, I tryna leave it, oh, I'm trying
But you still haunt me no matter where I go

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time and make it all alright
Only a piece of you and me will keep me warm all night
If I could turn back time and rewrite every line
If only I could, but baby, I can't

[Post-Chorus]
So I'ma scream, shout, let it all out
And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you
So I'ma scream, shout, let it all out
And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you

[Bridge]
Maybe it's a mistake if we let the clock break
Everything in my mind, everything in mind is telling me
That it's a mistake and it ends in heartbreak
Everything in my mind, everything in mind is telling me

[Chorus]
To try to turn back time and make it all alright
Only your piece of you and me will keep me warm all night
If I could turn back time and rewrite every line
If only I could, but baby, I can't

[Post-Chorus]
So I'ma scream, shout, let it all out
And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you
So I'ma scream, shout, let it all out
And scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you
